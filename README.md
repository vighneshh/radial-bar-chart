# Qliksense Radial Bar Chart Extension using amCharts.

## Introduction

This is qliksense radial bar chart extension I have created using [amCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/) javascript library. I have also add some custom settings so qlik user can customize and mess around to original amcharts API to have desirable custom effects.
